# Grards
###An online realtime cardgame 

This repository is for viewing a subsection of the code that runs [this](https://fungis.herokuapp.com/grards/) website. 
These files are part of a django app that runs the game. 

Grards is a multiplayer real-time card game based on apples 
to apples. My friends have created our own version with inside jokes which I put online during covid. Players can 
create games or join a game with a game code. The server communicates to the players using django channels, and jquery 
updates game screens without reloading. The site was designed with Figma and uses breakpoints for responsiveness. 
The cards are stored in a Postgres database and can be easly viewed and edited from a page on the site.
